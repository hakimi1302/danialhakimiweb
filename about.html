    <h3><center>HELLO</center></h3>
        <center><img src="Me.jpg" width="400" height="380"></center> <p> I am Danial Hakimi. I've always wanted to introduce myself as "D", so that I wouldn't have to tell people my real name, I would have preferred to use an alias instead of my own name, but I guess that isn't possible in real life. I'm sorry if the picture of the calligraphic written letter "D" does not satisfy my dear visitors on my website, as I really do not like to show my face to people. I've always been like that, but most of the time I'm forced to do it as it is a requirement in some places like some online classes or presentations.</p>
    
    
<p>In my whole 20 years of living, for the past 13 years, I've spent most of my time in front of my computer. I don't know why but I just find the online world fascinating. I think by the fact that I browsed and read some realities about this world on the internet had matured me at such a young age. I did well in primary school. But things changed in high school as I purposely flunked my exam results. All that solely for a reason that I didn't want to be recognized by people. As life goes on, I got into a college, despite having such bad grades in SPM. In reality, I'm just lucky that I have special privileges just because I'm Malay, because I know, I don't deserve to get into a college with bad results. I say that because I have friends who are not Malay, got 8A's and above but still, they are struggling to get into any college.</p>

<p>Everything changed when I got into a college. I've used almost my full potential in intelligence on most subjects and got 3 Dean Lists in a row. Although I didn't take some of the subjects seriously, but for some reason I managed to do that. But really, do i deserve to have this kind of knowledge? Some of my classmates, I know, were trying their best but they are nowhere near to my pointers. While I'm just playing around, I didn't even study for most of the exams, while they are pulling all-nighters for it. I don't understand why God gave me this ability. Really, I don't think I deserve those pointers at all. More or less, there is nothing interesting about me, that's all I can say.</p>
