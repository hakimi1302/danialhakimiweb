<h3><center>GENERAL</center></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>How old are you?</li>
        I'm 20 years old.
        <li>Since you play games alot, do you stream as well?</li>
        No, I don't. And I don't think I'm planning to but who knows. I just don't think my personality fits to be a streamer.
        <li>Are you in a relationship right now?</li>
        I'm not. So far I'm not really interested in those kind of stuff due to my complications from my past years.
        <li> Why your hair is always messy? (Yea, people actually ask this alot)</li>
        I don't comb my hair as much, I just think it's a waste of time. Most of the time I just leave it be. People would talk about it, but I don't care as much.

<h3><center>VIDEO EDITING</center></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>What software do you use?</li>
        I use Vegas Pro. Sometimes I use Premiere Pro but I'm still learning to use that software better. Also I am in progress of learning to use After Effects to boost up my video quality.
        <li>How did you learn video editing?</li>
        I've experimented with video editing ever since I was in primary school. When I first got into the field, I had fun. Therefore I continued to do that as I grew up and end up doing it effortlessly.
        </ul>

<h3><center>GAMING</center></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>What mouse do you use?</li>
        Currently, I'm using the Logitech G102. I'm thinking of upgrading to the Razer Deathadder V2.
        <li>What keyboard do you use?</li>
        I'm using the Logitech G213 Prodigy. Sometimes I switch to my OEM 60% Mechanical Keyboard which is made by Armageddon because it is smaller. I don't like using the smaller keyboard mainly because I could feel the click latency as I press a button and I don't like it. I didn't expect much from an OEM model.
        <li>What monitor do you use?</li>
        I'm using an AOC Monitor with 60hz refresh rate but 75hz refresh rate when used in lower resolution. I'm thinking of getting a 240hz refresh rate monitor like the BENQ Zowie 2456K to boost my performance in gaming. Yes, it does make a difference.
        <li>What are your PC specs?</li>
        I'm using a laptop. ROG Strix G531GU to be exact. Rocking with the Intel Core i7-9750H and a nvidia graphics card, the Nvidia Geforce GTX 1660 Ti. Also with the 16 GBs of RAM. You can look up my laptop model to get more information about it.
        <li>What games do you play?</li>
        I play VALORANT and Counter Strike:Global Offensive competitively. Sometimes I casually play Battlefield, GTA V, Among Us, Fall Guys, Dead By Daylight and other games too.
        <li>What are your sensitivities in competitive games like VALORANT?</li>
        In VALORANT, my sens is 0.355 while CSGO, 1.3. I use 800 DPI on my mouse.
